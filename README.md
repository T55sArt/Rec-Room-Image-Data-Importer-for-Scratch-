# Rec-Room-Image-Data-Importer-for-Scratch-
My first program on my first computer ever!

This is meant to be used with this scratch project:
https://turbowarp.org/893223720

To be used in Rec Room:
https://recroom.com/

with my printer invention:
https://rec.net/invention/6977045549365627338

in order to print images into the game! :D

when running, the prompts should give detail on what to do.

Addtional refferences to things like compiling, encoding, & such are most likely referencing Scratch, it has all you need to know about the shortcut keys.

hope your expereince goes well, happy printing!
